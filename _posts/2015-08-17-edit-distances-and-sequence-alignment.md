title: Sequence alignment in C++
date: 2015-08-17

During my senior year, I finally took a class on advanced C++. Surprisingly enough, it didn’t seem nearly as hard as the first one I had to struggle through a few years before, and I ended up having a lot of fun with it.

As final project, I decided to work on edit distances and implemented the [Wagner–Fischer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm) using dynamic programming. Later on, I expanded the project to also cover the [Needleman-Wunsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) for global sequence alignment.

Details and code are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/melanietosik/cpp2/blob/master/sda/README.md).

title: Semantic role labeling using CRF

My very last undergraduate project for a class on advanced language modeling, where we discussed the theoretical foundations of [hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) (HMM), the [Viterbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm) and [EM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm) algorithm, [log-linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-linear_model), [maximum entropy models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy#Maximum_entropy_models) (MEMM), and as well as [conditional random fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field) (CRF).

I finished the class with a [short paper on Semantic Role Labeling using Linear-Chain CRF]({{site.url}}/files/srl.pdf). The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/melanietosik/srl).

title: Semantic dependency graph parsing

For a class on semantic dependency graph parsing, I wrote a [simple script](https://github.com/melanietosik/dependency-graph-parsing) that computes statistics for semantic dependency graphs. It also generates plots for the distribution of words per [indegree and outdegree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph#Indegree_and_outdegree).

As final project, I submitted a comprehensive [review on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)]({{site.url}}/files/amr.pdf) -- a set of English sentences paired with simple, readable semantic representations.

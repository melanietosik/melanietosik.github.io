When I studied abroad in Northern Ireland, we discussed the notion of manner and result
in the roots of verbal meaning. See below for one of my favorite linguistics quotes.

> Consider an example where a zombie has died and been reanimated, and John drowns him.
>
> â€“ John Beavers

If this sounds intriguing, our [presentation slides]({{site.url}}/files/beavers.pdf) may or may not help clarify what we were talking about.

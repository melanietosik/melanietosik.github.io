For a really great class on [distributional semantics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics), I presented a paper on ["Measuring Distributional Similarity in Context"](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D10-1113) (Dinu and Lapata, 2010).

In a nutshell, they attempt to model the intuition that word meaning is represented as a probability distribution over a set of latent senses, and thus modulated by context. They employ two different models: the first based on [non-negative matrix factorization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization) (NMF), and the second implementing [latent Dirichlet allocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) (LDA).

My [final paper]({{site.url}}/files/dist_sem.pdf) and the [presentation slides]({{site.url}}/files/dinulapata.pdf) are available (in German).

Early on during my undergraduate, I took some classes in psycholinguistics, where we studied a wide range of interesting papers. Two of my personal favorites were "Expectation-based syntactic comprehension" (Levy, 2008) and "Dependency Locality Theory" (DLT) (Gibson, 2000), which we presented in class.

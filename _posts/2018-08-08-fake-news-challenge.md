title: Fake news and stance detection
date: 2018-08-08

For the term project of our natural language processing (NLP) class, I collaborated with two other NYU graduate students, [Antonio Mallia](https://www.antoniomallia.it/) and [Kedar Gangopadhyay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kedarg2005/). We decided to revisit the [Fake News Challenge (FNC-1)](http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/
) and experiment with different linguistic features to solve the task of stance (and ultimately, fake news) detection.

You can read all about our work in our paper called ["Debunking Fake News One Feature at a Time"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02831). The source code and additional details are a available in our [GitHub reposity](https://github.com/NYU-FNC/FakeNewsChallenge).

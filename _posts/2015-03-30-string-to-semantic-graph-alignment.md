title: String to semantic graph alignment

For my undergraduate thesis, I started working on semantic parsing: the problem of mapping natural language strings to meaning representations. In order to train a semantic parser for English to [Abstract Meaning Representation](https://amr.isi.edu/) (AMR), we first need to know which phrases in the input sentence invoked which concepts in the corresponding AMR graph. The project aimed at building an English/AMR aligner to solve this task automatically.

Here is my [final thesis]({{site.url}}/files/thesis.pdf), which was originally based on a paper titled ["Aligning English Strings with Abstract Meaning Representation Graphs"](https://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/amr_eng_align.pdf) (Pourdamghani et al., 2014).

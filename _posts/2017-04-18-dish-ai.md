At [WayBlazer](https://www.wayblazer.ai/), our product manager kept joking about how we needed an automated system (dubbed "dish AI") to review our catered lunches every day. So I built it, featuring a preprocessed [restaurant review data set](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge), [topic models](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/79360_850b2a69980c4488b1db95987a24867a.html), a [Markov chain generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators), and a [Flask API](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to put it all together!

In 2014, I was a research intern at [Textkernel](http://www.textkernel.com/), where we explored new methods of improving resume parsing for multi-lingual documents.

In order to extract structured information in the form of specific phrases like _name_ or _address_, we adopted the probabilistic [conditional random fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field) (CRF) framework. In addition, we experimented with a novel approach that integrates [continuous vector representations](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) of words as input features for such a model.

Next to my [internship report]({{site.url}}/files/report_tosik_textkernel.pdf), we also published a [paper detailing our work](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-1517) at NAACL-HTL 2015. Textkernel also released an [interview about my overall experience](http://www.textkernel.com/2014/12/internships-at-textkernel-melanie-tosik/
).

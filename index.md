**Hallo und willkommen!**


I'm Melanie. I work to design and implement robust application for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

I live in New York, where I'm a computer science Master's student at the NYU [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/). I also do consulting and grading work for various companies and  graduate-level courses.

I'm always interested in opportunities to collaborate, share, or teach, so please feel free to reach out any time. See below for my personal email address.

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/melanietosik), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanietosik/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meltomene). I'm excited to announce that I will be rejoining the data science team at BuzzFeed upon graduation! &#9734;&#xFE0E;

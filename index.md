Hall√∂chen! I'm Melanie. I work to design and implement robust application for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

I live in New York, where I'm a computer science Master's student at the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I also do consulting and grading work for various companies and  graduate-level courses.

I'm always interested in opportunities to collaborate, share, or teach, so feel free to [reach out via email](mailto:melanie.tosik@gmail.com) any time. If you're looking for a [current version of my resume, look no further]({{site.url}}/files/resume.pdf).

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/melanietosik), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanietosik/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meltomene).

**I'm looking forward to joining the data science team at BuzzFeed NY over the summer!**

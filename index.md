I'm Melanie. I work to design and implement robust application for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

I live in New York, where I'm a computer science (CS) Master's student at the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I also do consulting and grading work for various companies and  graduate-level courses.  

I'm always interested in opportunities to collaborate, share, or teach, so feel free to reach out [via email](mailto:melanie.tosik@gmail.com) any time. If you're looking for a [current version of my resume]({{site.url}}/files/resume.pdf), look no further.

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/melanietosik), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanietosik/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meltomene).

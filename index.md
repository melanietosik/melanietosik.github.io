**Hall√∂chen!**

I'm Melanie. I work to design and implement robust application for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

---

I live in New York, where I'm a computer science Master's student at the NYU [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/). I also do consulting and grading work for various companies and  graduate-level courses. This summer, I interned at [BuzzFeed](https://tech.buzzfeed.com/we-were-the-2018-buzzfeed-intern-class-and-now-were-crying-in-the-club-because-summer-s-over-dba1dcb85e0a)!

Hello, world!

I'm Melanie. I work to design and implement robust applications for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

I just relocated to New York, where I'll be joining the [MSCS program at NYU](https://www.cs.nyu.edu/home/master/prospective_mscs.html) this fall. I also started a new job as NLP/ML consultant at [Underdog.io](https://underdog.io/).

Here is a current version of [my resume (in PDF)]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/resume.pdf).

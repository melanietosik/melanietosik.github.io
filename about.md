Hello, world!

I'm Melanie. I work to design and implement robust applications for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

I'm currently at [WayBlazer](https://www.wayblazer.ai/), where I focus on generating personalized recommendations from natural language queries. I'll also be joining the [MSCS program at NYU](https://www.cs.nyu.edu/home/master/prospective_mscs.html) this fall.
